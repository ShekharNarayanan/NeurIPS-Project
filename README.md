# NeurIPS-Project
Solving the Cart-Pole Problem with deep Q learning

The project employs a Deep Q Network to solve the classic control problem described by
Barto, Sutton and Anderson: balancing a Cart-Pole on a track. When compared to a random
agent, the results of the project demonstrate higher performance in terms of reward-based
learning across the number of episodes the agent is trained on.
